#Learn and practice UnitTest with Android Kotlin

Final roadmap to create a unit test (it can be more elaborate, but for a beginner, this would suffice):

- Think of all the possible test cases.
- Create a method for each test case and annotate it with @Test
- Create a @Before method and initialize the Mockito library.
- Write your test cases using methods such as when, is, assertThat/False/True etc.
